  - Special moves (castling, en passant, pawn promotion)
  - Check, checkmate, and stalemate detection
  - 50-move rule for draws

- ðŸ¤– **AI Opponent**: 
  - Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
  - Position evaluation with piece-square tables
  - 3-ply search depth for balanced difficulty

- ðŸŽ¨ **Beautiful UI**:
  - Tokyo Night theme with dark mode aesthetic
  - Smooth animations and transitions
  - Responsive design for all devices
  - Visual indicators for legal moves and game status

## Tech Stack
